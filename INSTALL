== Dependencies ==
Your webserver needs to have xmlrpc php extention loaded.
This is called php5-xmlrpc in Debian/Ubuntu

== Installation and Configuration ==
Place MollomPlugin.php in the "local" folder of your laconica installation

Add the following to your config.php
<?php
addPlugin('Mollom');

$config['mollom']['public_key'] = '...';
$config['mollom']['private_key'] = '...';
$config['mollom']['servers'] = array('http://88.151.243.81', 'http://82.103.131.136');

?>

replace '...' with your own public and private keys for your site, which you can get from mollom.com

If you're using this plugin, i'd love to know about it -- shiny@cpan.org or shiny on freenode.
